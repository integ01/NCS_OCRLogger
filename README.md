Visual Metering/Logging for edge IOT devices (Or Logging my Solar system with NN-OCR)

An OCR (Optical character Recognition) system for visual logging of measurements from meters and displays.
The system deploys on a raspberry-pi system with Intel's new NCS for edge neural-networks.
My original use is for logging my solar panel system.
